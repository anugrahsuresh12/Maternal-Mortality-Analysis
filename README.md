# Maternal Mortality in the U.S.: Trends, Risk Factors, and Racial Disparities

**A comprehensive data-driven analysis examining maternal mortality trends, racial disparities, COVID-19 impact, and policy implications using publicly available CDC/NCHS data.**

## Overview

This project provides a statistical analysis of maternal mortality in the United States using publicly available CDC/NCHS datasets. The research examines temporal trends, racial and ethnic disparities, the differential impact of COVID-19, and regional variations to identify systemic factors contributing to preventable maternal deaths. The analysis employs descriptive statistics, ANOVA testing, equity assessments, and temporal trend analysis to produce actionable policy recommendations.

## The Problem

U.S. maternal mortality rates have risen significantly over the past two decades, reaching their highest level in over 50 years during the pandemic. While rates have since declined, they remain substantially higher than comparable high-income nations. The CDC estimates that the majority of pregnancy-related deaths are preventable, making this a critical public health issue.

## Research Objectives

1. **Temporal Trends**: Examine maternal mortality nationally and by state across time periods
2. **Racial/Ethnic Disparities**: Identify disparities and their evolution over the past two decades
3. **Risk Factors**: Explore chronic conditions and maternal age as contributing factors
4. **COVID-19 Pandemic Impact**: Assess how the pandemic differentially affected maternal mortality across groups
5. **Severe Maternal Morbidity (SMM)**: Link mortality data with SMM indicators to identify preventable patterns

## Data Sources and Methodology

Three primary datasets from CDC/NCHS were used: annual maternal mortality trends broken down by race/ethnicity, regional maternal mortality data across four U.S. regions, and long-term trend data for historical trajectory analysis.

The analytical approach included descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, ranges, disparity ratios), one-way ANOVA for statistical significance testing, temporal trend analysis with year-over-year percent changes, regional comparative analysis, and equity assessments using absolute and relative disparity measures.

## Key Findings

**Persistent Racial Disparities**: Black women experienced significantly higher maternal mortality rates compared to all other racial/ethnic groups. ANOVA testing confirmed these differences are statistically significant (p < 0.001). All five testable hypotheses were confirmed by the analysis.

**COVID-19 Amplified Inequality**: The pandemic disproportionately affected minority populations, with some groups experiencing their rates more than doubling. Black women reached the highest peak rates and had the largest absolute increases during the pandemic period.

**Unequal Recovery**: Post-pandemic recovery patterns diverged dramatically by race. Some groups improved beyond pre-pandemic levels while Black women remained the only group unable to return to their baseline rates.

**Regional Patterns**: The Northeast showed the highest Black maternal mortality despite having the best healthcare infrastructure, demonstrating that resources alone do not ensure equity. The Midwest achieved the smallest racial disparity gap, attributable to Medicaid expansion, community health centers, and strong social safety nets.

**Root Causes Point to Systemic Factors**: Statistical evidence eliminates individual factors as primary drivers. Disparities persist across all regions, income levels, and education levels, pointing instead to healthcare system bias, social determinants of health, and historical factors.

## Policy Recommendations

**Federal Level**: Mandate extended postpartum Medicaid coverage for all states, increase funding for community health centers, implement national paid family leave, invest in doula programs, and strengthen maternal mortality review systems.

**State/Healthcare Level**: Expand Medicaid postpartum coverage, require mandatory implicit bias training for obstetric providers, implement public reporting of outcomes by race, address maternity care deserts, and strengthen social safety nets.

## Economic Impact

The analysis found that achieving equity in maternal mortality could yield significant annual economic benefits through prevented deaths and reduced severe maternal morbidity, with intervention costs producing a net positive return on investment.

## Tools and Methods
